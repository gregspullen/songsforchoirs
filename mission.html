      <p>We aim to provide a new concept in music publishing. As musicians ourselves, we understand how choirs often struggle to buy new music. It‚Äôs a major budget concern ‚Äî so we bring you approachable, enjoyable works at the most competitive price we can offer.</p>

      <p>We only give you the composition: <em>you</em> provide the paper, ink, and everything else that goes into producing your vocal scores. Your purchases allow us to continue creating original works at the lowest possible cost to you.</p>

      <p>We sell our music in bundles, so you can order as close as possible to the number of copies you truly need. There are no price breaks for larger orders ‚Äî this is simply the most practical way to distribute our music securely and affordably.</p>

      <p>If we added more security, costs would inevitably rise, so we ask that you respect our copyright. A few ‚Äúextra copies‚Äù here and there can add up quickly when we‚Äôre sharing music with choirs around the world.</p>

      <p>Finally, we understand that printers misfeed and ink runs out ‚Äî things happen. If you have printing issues, just contact us and we‚Äôll help you resolve them. We want <strong>happy, singing customers!</strong> üé∂</p>
