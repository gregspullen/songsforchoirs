      <p>As musicians, we understand how your choir might struggle to buy new music. It‚Äôs a major budget concern ‚Äî so our aim is to bring you accessible, enjoyable works at the most competitive price we can offer.</p>

      <p>We supply the music and engraving: <em>you</em> provide the paper, ink, sticky tape and anything else that goes into producing your scores. Your patronage is what enables us to continue to supply new music at the lowest possible cost to you.</p>

      <p>Our music downloads in packs of 30 copies maximum. If you require more than 30 copies we ask you to place additional orders. There are no price breaks for larger orders ‚Äî this is simply the most practical way to distribute our music securely and affordably.</p>

      <p>Every download is watermarked with a unique ID. This watermark is our only security ‚Äî and also our trust. It‚Äôs how we keep our prices low so we ask that you respect our copyright. A few ‚Äúextra copies‚Äù here and there can add up quickly when we‚Äôre sharing music around the world, so if you need an extra copy or two, please buy them ‚Äî it‚Äôs less than the price of a coffee!</p>

      <p>We understand that printers misfeed and ink runs out ‚Äî things happen. If you have any downloading or printing issues, just email lyra@songsforchoirs.com and she‚Äôll help you resolve them. We want you to come back and buy more music! üé∂</p>
      
      <p>Finally and perhaps firstly, this is a new concept in music publishing and we do want to know if you have any problems with it. We've tested it as thoroughly as we can but if you do have issues please let us know straight away so that we can resolve them as quickly as possible.</p>
